How can I download some file in my test?
At some point of our career all of us will face the problem of downloading the file in the test.
As we remember, in Selenium it wasn’t that easy, because different browsers required different configurations like creating new user profile in Firefox and setting preferences:
profile.setPreference("browser.download.dir", downloadPath);
profile.setPreference("browser.download.folderList", 2);
profile.setPreference("browser.download.manager.showWhenStarting", false);
profile.setPreference("browser.helperApps.alwaysAsk.force", false);
profile.setPreference("browser.helperApps.neverAsk.saveToDisk", mimeTypes);
profile.setPreference("browser.download.manager.focusWhenStarting",false);
profile.setPreference("browser.download.manager.useWindow", false);
profile.setPreference("browser.download.manager.showAlertOnComplete", false);
profile.setPreference("pdfjs.disabled", true);

In Selenide,
this problem has been solved by adding $.download() method.
When we want to download some file, we just have to perform:
File report = element.download();
and Selenide will handle with all downloads window popup and just close them when process is finished.
Selenide will create new folder containing our file in build/reports/tests. This is the folder where Gradle generate its rest reports, so that it’s convenient to have them all together.
We can edit our download directory by changing default settings:
Configuration.reportsFolder = <desired location for downloaded files>;
